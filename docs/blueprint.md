## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#2962FF), chosen to instill confidence in data, evoke forward-thinking, and connect to conventional associations of business apps with the color blue.
- Background color: A light-blue tinted white (#F0F4FF), balancing vibrancy and calmness. This is close in hue to the blue primary color but highly desaturated and brightened to produce a contrasting backdrop.
- Accent color: A purple color (#9C27B0), for highlighting interactive elements and AI-driven features, selected from the hues neighboring the primary blue for an analogous, but contrasting effect.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a neutral, modern feel that suits both headlines and body text.
- Crisp, minimalist icons to represent data points and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Clean and structured layout to showcase data effectively, using white space and clear delineation between sections for enhanced readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements, such as filters and data updates, providing dynamic user feedback without distraction.
